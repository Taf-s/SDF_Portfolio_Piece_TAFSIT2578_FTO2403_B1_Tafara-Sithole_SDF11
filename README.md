This is the readme file for the Cache Bank Portfolio Piece

## Description

The purpose of the project was to bridge our theoretical understating with practical application furthering our understanding of creating user-centric web pages.

## Design Choices

Seeing as though we had the UX/UI design provided, there wasnt much design choices I needed to make.

Overall I was quite pleased with the way the Cache Bank Portfolio Piece came out, the features I am most proud of are:

- the burger menu, learning how to created a responsive mobile navigation using both tailwind and javascript.

## Technologies Used

- Tailwind for styling the page
- Javascript to create the functionality for the burger menu
